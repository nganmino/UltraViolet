				<h3>YTK Association as our commissioner</h3>
				<br>
				<p>YTK Association was found in 2005 to provide security and support for 
					individual career regardless of the field in Finland. The Association offers 
					a legal expenses insurance, vocational general liability insurance, 
					and leisure time accident insurance, as well as access to legal advice on 
					employment relationships from a lawyer by telephone.</p>
				<p>As a commision for Digital Design Services course, YTK asked the students of the course
					to design a digital tool to attract more students and ask them to either leave their 
					contact information or to join them as assoiciation members.</p>
				<p>According to YTK, the digital tool should provide a quick and simple process, with autmonation 
					as they do not have personnel to present at the location.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>Therefore, the requirements for UltraViolet is to make their digital tool:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Fun</li>
					<li>Takes around 3 minutes</li>
					<li>Simple equipment</li>
					<li>Easy access</li>
					<li>Automatic setup</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Persona</h3>
				<br>
				<p>To consider all possibilities there are for potential users, 
					UltraViolet created 3 personas in total, each of which has their own 
					background, financial situation and purposes.
				</p>
				<br>
				<br>

				<br>
				<h3>Scenarios</h3>
				<br>
				<p>Since each persona has their own background and purpose, each of them 
					would have different actions and create their own scenario. 
					To go further with this case, UltraViolet created a scenario for Sara because this persona 
					will go through all stages in her journey with our digital tool. 
				</p>
				<p>Sara is a full-time student in Haaga-Helia UAS. She lives with her parents in Helsinki. She wants to look for a
				part-time job to support her study and move out to live independently, but does not know how and where to start.
				</p>
				<p>One day, while she is waiting for her classmates in the lobby of Pasila campus, she notices a colourful touch screen
				with a puzzle game on it. It immediately catches her attention, so she approaches the screen. While she is playing the
				game, her friends arrive, hence she needs to leave the screen and goes with them. She scans the QR code on the screen to
				continue playing the game on her phone. She wins and a fun congratulation screen appears with a jumping YTK logo.</p>
				<p>Then a table of information appears just a second later, with information about YTK association and its different kinds
				of memberships. She skims over it and realises that the student benefits might be what she has been looking for.
				However, she needs to think more about it, so she leaves her email address and a question, and expects YTK to come back
				to her with more information. After submitting the contact information, she just realizes that her classmates may also
				be interested in this membership, hence she shares it to her class group chat on Whatsapp.</p>
				<p>A few seconds later, an email from YTK arrives. She opens it and sees that it contains FAQs, policies, lists of benefits
				and a link to registration form. After reading thoroughly, she decides to become a student member and signs up. She
				clicks on the link attached with the email to open a registration form. She fills in her information and submits it. An
				email arrives immediately to confirm that YTK received her application.</p>
				<p>On the next day, she gets another email informing her that her application is approved and she is now an official member
				of YTK association.</p>

				<h3>User Journey</h3>
				<br>
				<p>Our Digital Tool: A mini application on a touch screen placed at a public place, such as 
					a campus lobby, a cafeteria or a job fair.</p>
				<p>This application has a mini game displayed on its first screen to attract pass-byers. 
					After playing this game, users are automatically directed to the next screen with 
					information of YTK memberships. Then, then can decide to fill in YTK form to join, 
					or leave their contact information for YTK to contact them with further details.

				<h3>User Journey with suggestions for YTK</h3>
				<br>
				<p>We listed down all suggestions we have regarding both UX and UI for YTK in each stage.
				</p>

				<h3>Service Blueprint</h3>
				<br>
				<p>With this Service Blueprint, it is easier for YTK to check users' actions in each stage 
					and what response they should prepare. It also hinted that most of the response from YTK would be automatic
					without the need of having human presence except the stage of veryfing the registration attachments.</p>

				<br>
				<h3>Mockups</h3>
				<br>
				<p>Finally, based on the scenarios, we built the wireframe and then the UI mockups as presentations for YTK.</p>
				<p>There are interfaces of a touch screen (which are located in a public place) and 
				of a mobile phone (of the users if they choose to switch screen). </p>
